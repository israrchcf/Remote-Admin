## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols
2. **Enable 2FA**: Add extra layer of security to admin accounts
3. **Regular Access Review**: Audit user access permissions monthly
4. **Secure Networks**: Only access admin panel from trusted networks
5. **Log Monitoring**: Review access logs regularly for suspicious activity
6. **Keep Updated**: Apply security updates promptly

### For Deployment
1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive keys to version control
2. **HTTPS Only**: Enforce SSL/TLS for all connections
3. **Firewall Rules**: Restrict admin panel access to specific IP ranges
4. **Regular Backups**: Maintain encrypted backups with tested restore procedures
5. **Security Scanning**: Run automated vulnerability scans regularly

### For Device Monitoring
1. **Explicit Consent**: Obtain written consent before monitoring
2. **Clear Disclosure**: Inform users about monitoring scope and purpose
3. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data for legitimate purposes
4. **Regular Review**: Audit collected data and remove unnecessary information
5. **Incident Response**: Have procedures for data breaches or misuse

  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null && auth.token.email_verified == true",
    ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.email_verified == true",
    "devices": {
      ".indexOn": ["userId", "lastSeen"],
      "$deviceId": {
        ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['deviceId', 'lastSeen'])"
      }
    }
  }
}

// Firestore
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.token.email_verified == true
        && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
  }
}
```
