# Project Documentation

## Overview
This is a full-stack JavaScript application migrated from Bolt to Replit, featuring:
- Express.js backend with TypeScript
- React frontend with Vite
- Shared schema with Drizzle ORM
- In-memory storage implementation
- shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS

## Project Architecture

### Remote-Admin System Components

#### Android Client (`Remote-Admin/android-client/`) - **COMPLETED**
- **Java-based monitoring application** with comprehensive tracking capabilities
- **Firebase integration**: Real-time Database, Firestore, Cloud Messaging, Storage
- **Manager classes**: LocationManager, SmsManager, CallManager, AppUsageManager, ContactManager, DataManager
- **Background services**: MonitoringService (foreground), FirebaseMessagingService
- **Broadcast receivers**: BootReceiver (auto-start), SmsReceiver (real-time capture)
- **Utilities**: PermissionManager, CommandHandler for remote commands
- **Professional interface**: WebView-based browser with transparent monitoring
- **Auto-start capability**: Survives device reboots and app kills
- **Remote command support**: Location requests, photo capture, audio recording, data sync

#### React Frontend (`Remote-Admin/src/`) - **COMPLETED**
- **Complete admin dashboard** with tabbed navigation (Overview, Devices, Activity, Map)
- **Firebase integration**: Authentication, Realtime Database, Firestore, Cloud Messaging
- **Authentication system**: Email/password login with AuthContext and protected routes
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live device status, location tracking, SMS/call activity feeds
- **Remote commands**: Device control via Firebase Cloud Messaging with confirmation dialogs
- **UI components**: Button, Input, Card, DeviceList, ActivityFeed, CommandCenter, LocationMap
- **Data hooks**: Custom React hooks for real-time Firebase data (devices, locations, SMS, calls)
- **Professional styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design and loading states

#### Laravel Backend (`Remote-Admin/web-admin-panel/`) - **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**
- MVC structure with DashboardController and FirebaseService
- Missing authentication, API routes, and complete admin interface

### Legacy Backend (`server/`)
- `index.ts` - Express server setup with middleware and error handling
- `routes.ts` - API route handlers (currently empty template)
- `storage.ts` - In-memory storage implementation with user management
- `vite.ts` - Vite development server configuration (do not modify)

### Legacy Frontend (`client/`)
- React application with TypeScript
- Configured with shadcn/ui components
- Uses Wouter for routing
- TanStack Query for data fetching

### Shared (`shared/`)
- `schema.ts` - Drizzle schema definitions and Zod validation schemas

## Configuration Files
- Uses Node.js 20 with ES modules
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- Vite for frontend bundling
- TypeScript throughout the stack

## Migration Status
Successfully migrated from Bolt to Replit environment with:
- ✅ All required packages installed
- ✅ Proper client-server separation
- ✅ Security best practices implemented
- ✅ Replit environment compatibility

## Development Guidelines
Following full-stack JavaScript best practices:
- Frontend-heavy architecture with minimal backend
- Shared type definitions for consistency
- In-memory storage preferred unless database required
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind for styling

## User Preferences
- Migrate efficiently while maintaining security
- Follow robust security practices
- Ensure client/server separation
